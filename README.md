Code block for macOS with line numbers made in AppKit.

Also includes syntax highlighting done using Highlightr (https://github.com/raspu/Highlightr.git).

Hiding the line numbers is possible with a button in the UI.

When making a selection, the corresponding line numbers are visually highlighted within the code block.
