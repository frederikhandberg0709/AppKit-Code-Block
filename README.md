# AppKit Code Block

Code block for macOS with line numbers made in AppKit.
Also includes syntax highlighting done using Highlightr (https://github.com/raspu/Highlightr.git).

Hiding the line numbers is possible with a button in the UI.

**Known bug:** It is currently not possible to select the last line if its empty - in other words, if it's a newline.
Will be fixed ASAP.
